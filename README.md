# CRDIR Research Abstract
Particles that bombard the Earth from anywhere beyond its atmosphere are known as a cosmic ray. Although we are not able to see the cosmic ray nor feel it, it exists outside the atmosphere and may cause the damage to the sensors of the digital cameras used in space. Hence, the images taken by the cameras are damaged. From the existed sample images, the damages often appear as abnormally saturated high-value pixels. The main goal of the project is to locate the hot pixels accurately without falsely identifying the stars or other saturated objects. Two old methods will be evaluated, and three new methods are proposed in this research. The comparison of the images before and after being processed by each method are made to determine the efficiency of the methods. In this research, The new methods include Single Image Comparison Based on the Nature of Light, Image Sequence Comparison Based on Single Image Comparison, and Image Sequence Comparison Based on Histogram Analysis. The conclusion will be drawn, and the suggestions are made for future space exploration.
